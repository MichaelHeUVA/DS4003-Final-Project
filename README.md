## Project Description

This dashboard is designed to offer a comprehensive analysis of salaries within the data science profession, focusing on how various factors such as company size, experience level, work year, company location, remote ratios, and employment type influence salary outcomes. It is intended for data scientists at all career stages, hiring managers, HR professionals, and industry analysts who are interested in understanding the latest compensation trends in the field.

The driving force behind the creation of this dashboard was to show the distribution of data science salaries over time. By providing a detailed breakdown based on real-world data, the dashboard aims to assist data scientists in negotiating fair compensation and help employers set competitive salaries to attract top talent.

Users can select specific years to see how salaries have changed over time, reflecting industry growth and inflation adjustments.
